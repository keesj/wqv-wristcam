		<h2>General packet information</h2>
		<p>
		All packet start with C0 and end with C1. The watch is quit passive and only answers to request.
		The only exception seems to be that the packet that acknoleges a new created session is sent 3 time.
		</p>
		<p>
The second byte of a packet is the session id. When the session is not yet started the session id is FF<BR>
		</p>
		<p>
		The two last bytes of a packet(before C1) are a checksum. The checksum is calculated by adding all values of the packet (starting with the session id) to each other string the value in a "2 byte value".<BR>
		<PRE>
int checksum =0;
for all bytes to send {
	checksum += bytevalue;
}
checksum = checksum % 0x1000;
checksum1 = (checksum / 0x100);
checksum2 = (checksum % 0x100);
</PRE>
</p>

<H3>first packet</H3>
The communication is started by sending a packet containing B3<BR>

<H3>second packet</H3>
<IMG SRC="02-challenge-request.gif" alt="challenge request image"><BR>
<B>note probably the time is used at this point as a "random key" for the next packet</B>


<H3>third packet</H3>

<p>
it looks like commandos exists of 3 parameter

<H3>image format</H3>
 When transfering data to the computer by means of the pad2 the wacht uses this format.
 Casio images are stored with the .BIN extention. the image format
 is quit simple.<BR>
 try to keep your image in this format it has useluff meta-data
 <UL>
    <LI>The image format has a contant size of 7229 bytes.</LI>
    <LI>The first 24 bytes a the image title(ascii)</LI>
    <LI>The next 5 bytes are the date and time
       <UL>
          <LI>year starting from 2000 (int value of byte + 2000 = year) 0..255</LI>
          <LI>month (int value of byte = month) 0..11</LI>
          <LI>day of month (int value of byte = day) 0..31</LI>
          <LI>hour of day(int value of byte = hour) 0..24</LI>
          <LI>minutes of day(int value of byte = minutes) 0..59</LI>
       </UL>
    </LI>
    <LI>The next 120 * 60 bytes are the actual image.
         The image is 120 times 120 pixels with 16 greyscales
         each pixel is stored in 4 bits so one byte contains 2 pixels
         the value of the 4 bits is the darkness so 0 (0x0) is white and 16 (0xf) is black.
         The order is different from what I would expect (the pixel in the 4 MSB is right  of the pixel in the LSB)
    </LI>
